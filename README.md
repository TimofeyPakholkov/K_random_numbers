Technical task:

Implement a function in C++, which for a given array A of size N with double-precision floating-
point numbers (64 bits per number) and some positive integer number K, performs summation of 
K randomly selected elements from the array A with the uniform probability (probabilities to select
i-th element and j-th element are equal for any i and j) with replacement (each element can be
selected more than once). Try to have correct summation result and to have your implementation
performance-efficient (assuming that N and/or K can be big enough, for example, N >= 50,000,000,
K >= 50,000,000).
